Installation instructions:
--------------------------
clone the repo
cd into directory
make sure you have python <=3.8 (req. for Binance) and pip installed, and virtualenv if you want an isolated env.
To install required packages just run:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Requires Binance API, and Discord API for notifications though that can be disabled. 
Requires a Binance API key in a file 'config.py'. 
Create a Binance account at https://www.binance.com/, then go to Account -> Settings -> API Management, create and copy the API key + secret to config.py as API_KEY and API_SECRET. 
Note it is stronly recommended to change the restrictions on your API key to only alolow read only operations - disallow trades if you're not going to be trading using the key - and restrict the usage of the API key to your own IP address, and set up 2FA for your account. Obviously choose strong accopunt password. 
Requires a Discord webhook URL if you want Discord notifications. Open Discord, log in, create a discord channel, got to Server Settings -> Integrations -> Webhooks -> New Webhook, give it a name and copy the URL, save it alongside the Binanace API key as DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL

Installing a virtualenv:
------------------------
pip install virtualenv
cd my-project
python3 -m venv myvenv
.\myvenv\Scripts\activate
deactivate

List packages:
--------------
pip list

Update packages:
----------------
pip freeze  # list packages
pip freeze > requirements.txt # save reqs to file for easy recreation of venv

Blow venv away and rebuild:
---------------------------
rm -r myvenv   # nuke old venv
python3 -m venv myvenv/     # create a new one
pip install -r requirements.txt    # reinstall all required packages.


Ionstalling Binance and Discord individually if required:
---------------------------------------------------------
pip install python-binance # needs python <=3.8

py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py
